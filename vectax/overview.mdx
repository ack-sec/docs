## The Challenge

In today's AI landscape, organizations face a critical trade-off between innovation and security. Traditional encryption breaks AI functionality, forcing teams to choose between protecting sensitive data and maintaining AI performance. This creates significant risks in regulatory compliance, data privacy, and intellectual property protection.

# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with Mirror Vectax SDK in 15 minutes.

## Requirements

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
Python 3.9+
Mirror Vectax API key
OpenAI API key (optional - for examples)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Core SDK">
```bash
# Install core SDK
pip install mirror-sdk

# For examples with OpenAI and ChromaDB
pip install mirror-sdk[examples]
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Environment">
```bash
export MIRROR_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"  # if using examples
```
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize SDK">
```python
from mirror_sdk.core.mirror_core import MirrorSDK, MirrorConfig

config = MirrorConfig.from_env()
sdk = MirrorSDK(config)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Usage

### Secure Vector Operations

<CodeGroup>
```python Vector Operations
from mirror_sdk.core.models import VectorData

# Encrypt model embeddings
embeddings = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
vector = VectorData(vector=embeddings, id="customer_vector")
encrypted = sdk.vectax.encrypt(vector)

# Decrypt when needed
decrypted = sdk.vectax.decrypt(encrypted)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Access Control

<CodeGroup>
```python Access Control
# Set up access policies
policy = {
    "roles": ["data_scientist", "analyst"],
    "groups": ["research"],
    "departments": ["ai"]
}
sdk.set_policy(policy)

# Generate user access key
user_key = sdk.rbac.generate_user_secret_key({
    "roles": ["data_scientist"],
    "groups": ["research"],
    "departments": ["ai"]
})
```
</CodeGroup>

## Real-World Example

Here's a complete example of securing an AI workflow:

<CodeGroup>
```python Complete Example
import openai
from mirror_sdk.core.models import VectorData

# 1. Get document embedding
doc = "Customer feedback analysis"
embedding = openai.embeddings.create(
    model="text-embedding-3-small",
    input=doc
).data[0].embedding

# 2. Encrypt embedding
vector = VectorData(
    vector=embedding,
    id="feedback_1"
)
encrypted = sdk.vectax.encrypt(vector)

# 3. Set access controls
policy = {
    "roles": ["analyst"],
    "groups": ["customer_success"]
}
user_key = sdk.rbac.generate_user_secret_key(policy)

# 4. Secure metadata
metadata = {
    "source": "feedback_survey",
    "date": "2024-03-01"
}
key = sdk.metadata.generate_key()
tweak = sdk.metadata.generate_tweak_from_data(metadata)
encrypted_metadata = sdk.metadata.encrypt(metadata, key, tweak)
```
</CodeGroup>
