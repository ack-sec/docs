## Detection Methods

Our rules implement various detection techniques:

- **Pattern Matching**: Identifies specific patterns in inputs and outputs
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Analyzes agent behavior over time
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies deviations from normal patterns
- **Signature-Based**: Matches against known malicious patterns
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Uses experience-based techniques to detect threats
- **Log Analysis**: Examines logs for suspicious activity

## Using Rules in Your Application

To implement these rules in your AgentIQ application:

```python
from agentiq.security import SecurityRules

# Initialize with default rules
security = SecurityRules()

# Add a specific rule by ID
security.add_rule("data_protect_sensitive_content")

# Add all rules from a category
security.add_category("RAG")

# Apply rules to your agent
agent.with_security(security)
```

## Customizing Rules

You can customize existing rules or create your own:

```python
# Modify an existing rule
security.customize_rule("data_protect_sensitive_content", 
                        severity="MEDIUM",
                        threshold=0.75)

# Create a custom rule
security.create_rule({
    "name": "custom_pii_detector",
    "description": "Custom PII detection for our application",
    "severity": "HIGH",
    "type": "prevention",
    "detection_methods": ["pattern_matching"],
    "category": {
        "code": "DPR",
        "name": "Data Protection"
    },
    # Rule-specific configuration
    "config": {
        "patterns": ["custom-pattern-1", "custom-pattern-2"],
        "threshold": 0.9
    }
})
```

## Best Practices

For optimal security implementation:

1. **Layer your defenses**: Combine multiple rule types for comprehensive protection
2. **Start in detection mode**: Begin with rules in detection mode to understand impact
3. **Monitor and adjust**: Regularly review rule performance and tune accordingly
4. **Custom extensions**: Extend rules for your specific use cases
5. **Regular updates**: Keep your rule catalog updated to protect against new threats
