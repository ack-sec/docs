The AgentIQ Policy Engine provides comprehensive governance, security, and compliance controls for AI applications. It enables you to define, enforce, and monitor policies that regulate AI behavior across your entire application ecosystem.

## How It Works

The Policy Engine intercepts interactions with your AI models and validates them against your defined policies. It can:

1. **Analyze inputs** to detect and prevent prompt injection, PII exposure, and other security risks
2. **Verify outputs** to ensure they meet safety requirements and don't contain sensitive information
3. **Monitor operations** to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements
4. **Collect telemetry** for auditing and continuous improvement

## Implementation Approaches

AgentIQ offers multiple ways to implement policy enforcement:

### Python Decorators

The simplest way to add policy protection is through Python decorators:

```python
from mirror_sdk.ops.mirror_decorators import policy_monitor

@policy_monitor(name="my_security_policy")
async def generate_response(user_query: str) -> str:
    # Your AI generation code here
    return response
```

### Middleware Integration

For more complex applications, you can integrate the policy engine as middleware:

```python
from mirror_sdk import PolicyMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
policy_middleware = PolicyMiddleware(policy_name="api_security_policy")
app.add_middleware(policy_middleware)
```

### Programmatic API

For maximum flexibility, use the policy engine directly:

```python
from mirror_sdk import PolicyEngine, PolicySource

engine = PolicyEngine()
policy_source = PolicySource(id="my_security_policy")
policy_content = await engine.get_policy_content(policy_source)
result = await engine.evaluate_trace(policy_content, trace_data)
```
