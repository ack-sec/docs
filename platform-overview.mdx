# Mirror Security Platform Overview

The Mirror Security Platform provides a comprehensive security framework for GenAI applications, addressing the unique challenges of securing AI systems while maintaining their functionality and performance.

## Platform Architecture


Our platform consists of two main products that can be used independently or together for complete protection:

1. **Mirror Vectax SDK**: Provides data-level security through  encryption.
2. **AgentIQ Policy Engine**: Delivers application-level security through policy enforcement.
3. **Discover** : GenAI Security Scanner and Automated RedTeaming Suite. 

## Mirror Vectax SDK

<Info>
  Mirror Vectax SDK enables privacy-preserving AI by providing  encryption designed for machine learning operations.
</Info>

Vectax SDK focuses on data protection with  cryptographic techniques designed specifically for AI operations:

  <Card title="Secure Vector Operations">
    Enterprise-grade security for vector operations with similarity-preserving encryption. Protect your embeddings while maintaining searchability.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fine-Grained Access Control">
    Built-in RBAC with multi-dimensional policies. Control access at role, group, and department levels with comprehensive audit trails.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Format-Preserving Encryption">
    Encrypt sensitive data while maintaining format and searchability. Perfect for securing metadata, PII, and structured data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Secure Agents Pipeline">
    End-to-end security for machine learning workflows. From data ingestion to model serving, protect every step of your ML pipeline.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key Technologies

- **Similarity-Preserving Encryption (SPE)**: Allows encrypted vector similarity search
- **Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE)**: Maintains data format while encrypting
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Enables fine-grained permissions
- **Secure Multi-party Computation**: Enables collaborative AI without sharing raw data

## AgentIQ Policy Engine

<Info>
  The AgentIQ Policy Engine provides comprehensive governance, security, and compliance controls for AI applications.
</Info>

AgentIQ focuses on application-level security through policy definition and enforcement:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Declarative Policy Grammar">
    Define policies using a simple, readable grammar that's both powerful and intuitive.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Real-time Enforcement">
    Apply policies at runtime to prevent violations before they occur.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Comprehensive Protection">
    Built-in rules for PII protection, prompt safety, RAG security, and more.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Seamless Integration">
    Apply policies through simple decorators with minimal code changes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key Technologies

- **Policy Definition Language**: Simple yet powerful grammar for defining security rules
- **Runtime Inspection**: Real-time inspection of AI inputs and outputs
- **Compliance Mapping**: Automatic mapping of policies to regulatory frameworks
- **Telemetry Collection**: Comprehensive logging and auditing capabilities
