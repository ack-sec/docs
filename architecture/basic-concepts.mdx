# Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

## Overview

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data without requiring decryption, providing end-to-end security for sensitive data processing.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Raw Data] -->|Encrypt| B[Encrypted Data]
    B -->|Compute| C[Encrypted Result]
    C -->|Decrypt| D[Final Result]
    
    subgraph "FHE Operations"
        B
        E[Encrypted Data 2] -->|Add/Multiply| C
    end
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Privacy-Preserving Analytics
- Process sensitive data while encrypted
- Aggregate results securely
- Maintain data privacy

### 2. Secure Financial Computations
- Protected transaction processing
- Encrypted balance calculations
- Secure audit trails

### 3. Healthcare Analysis
- Process patient data securely
- Protected health metrics
- Compliant data analysis



# Vector Encryption

## Overview

Vector encryption enables secure storage and processing of vector embeddings while preserving their similarity properties.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Vector Data] -->|Encrypt| B[Encrypted Vector]
    B -->|Store/Process| C[Secure Operations]
    C -->|Search/Compare| D[Similar Vectors]
    D -->|Decrypt| E[Results]
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Secure ML Model Feature Storage
- Store model embeddings securely
- Protect proprietary model features
- Enable secure model inference

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Analytics
- Analyze customer behavior patterns
- Secure storage of user preferences
- Protected A/B test results


# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

## Overview

RBAC provides fine-grained access control over encrypted data based on organizational roles and structure.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Access Control
        A[User] -->|Request| B[RBAC Policy]
        B -->|Verify| C[Access Decision]
        C -->|Grant/Deny| D[Protected Resource]
    end
    
    subgraph Policies
        E[Roles]
        F[Groups]
        G[Departments]
    end
    
    E & F & G -->|Define| B
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Enterprise Document Management
- Different access levels for departments
- Team-based document access
- Project-specific content restrictions

### 2. Healthcare Data Access
- Doctor/Patient data segregation
- Department-specific record access
- Regulatory compliance enforcement


# Format Preserving Encryption (FPE)

## Overview

FPE enables encryption while maintaining the original data format, crucial for systems with strict format requirements.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Original Format] -->|Encrypt| B[Preserved Format]
    B -->|Process| C[Compatible Systems]
    C -->|Decrypt| D[Original Format]
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Customer Data Protection
- Credit card number encryption
- Social security number protection
- Phone number anonymization

### 2. Healthcare Records
- Patient ID encryption
- Medical record number protection
- Insurance ID encryption


# Encrypted Inference

## Overview

Encrypted inference combines FHE, vector encryption, and RBAC to enable secure ML model deployment and prediction.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Client
        A[Input Data] -->|1. Encrypt| B[Encrypted Input]
    end
    
    subgraph Secure Processing
        B -->|2. Process| C[Encrypted Model]
        C -->|3. Compute| D[Encrypted Prediction]
    end
    
    subgraph Access Control
        E[RBAC Policy] -->|Verify| C
    end
    
    D -->|4. Decrypt| F[Final Prediction]
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Secure Model Deployment
- Protected model weights
- Secure inference pipeline
- Access-controlled predictions

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Predictions
- Secure input processing
- Protected feature extraction
- Confidential results
